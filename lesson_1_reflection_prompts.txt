What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The benefits with manually choosing commit is that we can decide when save
    the save changes (and this changes can't be to small or to high)

    disadvantage off manually choosing when create a commit will be if we forget
    to create commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because from Git we can see wich type of files is changed and then we can view
    changes from each of these files
