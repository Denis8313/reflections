When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want create remote repository hen more developer working in one application

Why might yout want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay upt-to-date with your remote repository?

I want to always pull changes manually becouse i don't want have to small commits and I want the application I set up on a remote does not crash but to have an always stable version

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks - I use forks when I want to link the application development with multiple users online and I 
do not want or can not change the source code

Clones - When I develop my own application with multiple developers

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefits is that we can access all the changes that have been made and work with the application locally

How would you collaborate without using Git of GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without git it would be much harder to develop an application, with git we can easily develop the test version
of the application without fear of destroying a stable version of the application, also with Git Hub it is much 
easier to develop application in witch is including more developers.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

A special branch would use when more people are involved in a file's change
